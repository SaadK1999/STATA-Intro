# STATA-Intro

This was a project I completed in STATA (A statistical analysis program) during Second year and achieved 98%

The project was an introduction to Multiple regressions and hypothesis testing

The DO FILE is where I wrote my code in STATA

The LOG FILE is a record of my commands

The project is where I neatly display my regressions table and answers about methodology as well as my thoughts on the conclusion
